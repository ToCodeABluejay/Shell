# Shell
I couldn't come up with a unique codename yet, but this is just a simple shell project that I started for school, but have since developed to fit my own specifications seperate from the original project.

It is a pretty simple shell with just a few basic internal functions, and it should be able to be compiled on most machines without any need for any compiler flags.

Simply compile with the following command:
cc command.c main.c string.c -o shell -g

The '-g' is included in order to include debugging symbols to be used when running through a debugger, as it is not stable yet.
