# Shell
I couldn't come up with a unique codename yet, but this is just a simple shell project that I started for school, but have since developed to fit my own specifications separate from the original project.

It is a pretty simple shell with just a few basic internal functions, and it should be able to be compiled on most Unix-like systems without any need for any compiler flags.

Simply compile and install with the following commands:

    $ make
    # make install
    $ make clean

And then install by copying into your binaries! :)
