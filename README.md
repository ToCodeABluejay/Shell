# Shell
I couldn't come up with a unique codename yet, but this is just a simple shell project that I started for school, but have since developed to fit my own specifications seperate from the original project.

It is a pretty simple shell with just a few basic internal functions, and it should be able to be compiled on most machines without any need for any compiler flags.
